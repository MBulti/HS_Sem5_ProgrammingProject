# HS_Sem5_ProgrammingProject

HS Osnabr√ºck - 5 Semester - Assessment for the module Programming Project

## Note

Implementation of the API interface only.
Implementation of the frontend is handled in a separate repository. (https://github.com/MBulti/HS_Sem5_ProgrammingProject_Frontend)

## Task description

Netflix streams movies to its users andshared its data to provide improved
movie recommendations. You are tasked to create a recommenation system for its users.

To do this exercise, the company provides several files, such as information on the movies, and user ratings,
summing up to a total of 480189 unique users and 17770 movies.
As the movie details provided in the data-set you are expected to take advantage of publicly available information, such as the latest IMDb information here
https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/.

## Project Management

The project is implemented in three sprints. Management is carried out via Jira.

## Access via Frontend

The frontend of this application is available via
https://programmierprojekt.com

## Deployment

The API is deployed via a ci/cd pipeline using github actions. With the deployment of new changes the python file is tested and later pushed to the heroku app.

Both the linting and code validity is checked before doing so.

Only after the build step is completed the deploy step begins

The three relevant enpoints are as follows:

### This index html file

https://recommender-system-hs.herokuapp.com/

### The list of available movies

https://recommender-system-hs.herokuapp.com/movies

### A recommendation based on a given movie id

https://recommender-system-hs.herokuapp.com/recommendation?movies=111

or for multiple

https://recommender-system-hs.herokuapp.com/recommendation?movies=111,420,69
